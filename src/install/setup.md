# Setup

With git installed, run the following to setup your user

```bash
git config --global user.name "First Last"
git config --global user.email "youremail@company.com"
```
This tells git your name and email to sign off on commits with, so others know who added what code. 

The `config` tells git you want to configure something, and `--global` tells it that you want to set this for all repos, not just the current one you are using (which is probably none at all right now).
