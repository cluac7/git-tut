# Your Local Repo

Git is a source control system that tracks repositories between different people. This begins with you making a new repo on your own system.


If you already have some code ready, you should start by going into the root folder, and running:
```bash
git init
```
This turns your folder into a git repo.

Otherwise, make a new empty folder, and run git init inside it.
